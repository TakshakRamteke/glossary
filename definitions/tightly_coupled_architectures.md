## Tightly Coupled Architectures

### What it is

Tightly Couple Architecture's is a concept of system design and computing where every hardware and software components are linked together in such manner that every component is dependent upon each other. It promotes interdependent applications and code which are fragile, as a minor issue in one segment can bring the whole system down. Tightly Coupled Architectures integrates enterprise applications around a single point of truth, which is often a single spatially-enabled RDBMS.

### Problem it addresses

Tightly Coupled Architecture's mainly addresses problems related to having a very low data rate and inconsistency.

### How it helps

Tightly Coupled Architecture's provides rapid and efficient processing of large volumes of data, it also provides a single point of truth instead of several, often redundant, data sources, and enables open access to data throughout the organization. And hence this type of architecture is also used in parallel processing systems.
